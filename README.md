# Hough Transform - Line Detection

Python implementation of hough transform for detecting lines in images.    
Explanation of how the hough transform works in my blog post: [Understanding Hough Transform](http://scriptogr.am/alyssa/post/understanding-hough-transform-with-python)

## Usage
```py
python hough_transform.py
```
## Sample
